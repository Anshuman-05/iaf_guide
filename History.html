                                <p>The first time an aircraft 'took-off’ in India was on 10th March 1910, when a
                                    Corsican hotelier based in
                                    Madras, Giacomo D'Angelis, flew a Biplane he had designed. Interestingly, that was a
                                    mere seven years
                                    after the historical flight of Wright brothers, as they introduced the world to
                                    their new invention, at
                                    Kittyhawk, USA on 17th December 1903.
                                </p>
                                <p>Very soon, some British army officers, who became flying enthusiasts, realized the
                                    potential of using
                                    this new invention in warfare. In 1913, Captain SD Massey of 29th Punjab Regiment,
                                    Indian Army,
                                    established a military flying school at Sitapur (around 90 km from Lucknow) in
                                    present-day Uttar
                                    Pradesh. The units trained here went on to serve in World War I (1914-1918), under
                                    the unofficial name
                                    of Indian Air Corps. Indra Lal Roy (1898-1918), a scion of a wealthy Bengali
                                    zamindari family and a
                                    member of the Indian Air Corps, is considered to be the first Indian Fighter
                                    Aircraft Pilot. His nephew,
                                    Subroto Mukherjee would go on to become the first Indian to become the ‘Chief of Air
                                    Staff’ in 1954.

                                <p>On 1st April 1918, the Indian Air Corps would be reorganized as a part of the Royal
                                    Air Force (RAF),
                                    which operated out of Risalpur (near Peshawar), Quetta, Ambala (Punjab) Lahore and
                                    Sitapur (UP).
                                    However, this was just an arm of the British Air Force, used for operations against
                                    tribes along the
                                    Afghan border. By 1927, there was strong pressure to establish, a separate Airforce
                                    for India. In 1930,
                                    six Indian cadets were selected for training at the RAF College at Cranwell in
                                    Lincolnshire UK and in
                                    January 1932, around 29 technicians, mostly from railway workshops were appointed as
                                    ‘<em>Havai Sepoys</em>’ to work as ground staff. Finally, on 8th October 1932, the
                                    then Government of (British)
                                    India passed the ‘Indian Air Force Act’ and a new branch of the Indian armed forces,
                                    the Indian Air Force or the erstwhile Royal Indian Air Force, was officially born.

                                    The IAF's first ac flight came into being on 01 Apr
                                    1933. The aircraft inventory comprised of four Westland Wapiti IIA army co-operation
                                    biplanes
                                    at Drigh Road as the "A" Flight nucleus of the planned No.1 (Army Co- operation)
                                    Squadron.

                                    Four-and-a-half years later, "A" Flight was in action for the first time from
                                    Miranshah,
                                    in North
                                    Waziristan, to
                                    support Indian Army operations against insurgent Bhittani tribesmen. Meanwhile, in
                                    April
                                    1936, a "B" Flight
                                    had
                                    also been formed on the vintage Wapiti. But, it was not until June 1938 that a "C"
                                    Flight was raised to
                                    bring
                                    No. 1 Squadron ostensibly to full strength, and this remained the sole IAF formation
                                    when World War II
                                    began,
                                    although personnel strength had by now risen to 16 officers and 662 men.

                                    Problems concerning the defence of India were reassessed in 1939 by the Chatfield
                                    Committee. It proposed the
                                    re-equipment of RAF (Royal Air Force) squadrons based in lndia but did not make any
                                    suggestions for the
                                    accelerating the then painfully slow growth of IAF except for a scheme to raise five
                                    flights on a voluntary
                                    basis to assist in the defence of the principal ports. An IAF Volunteer Reserve was
                                    thus authorised, although
                                    equipping of the proposed Coastal Defence Flights (CDFs) was somewhat inhibited by
                                    aircraft availability.
                                    Nevertheless, five such flights were established with No. 1 at Madras, No. 2 at
                                    Bombay, No. 3 at Calcutta, No. 4
                                    at Karachi and No. 5 at Cochin. No. 6 was later formed at Vizagapatanam. Built up
                                    around a nucleus of regular
                                    IAF and RAF personnel, these flights were issued with both ex-RAF Wapitis and those
                                    relinquished by No. 1
                                    Squadron IAF after its conversion to the Hawker Hart. In the event, within a year,
                                    the squadron was to revert
                                    back to the Wapiti because of spares shortages, the aged Westland biplanes being

                                    At the end of March 1941, Nos. 1 and 3 CDFs gave up their Wapitis which were
                                    requisitioned to equip No. 2
                                    Squadron raised at Peshawar in the following month, and were instead issued with
                                    Armstrong Whitworth Atalanta
                                    transports, used to patrol the Sunderbans delta area south of Calcutta. No. 2 CDF
                                    had meanwhile received
                                    requisitioned D.H. 89 Dragon Rapides for convoy and coastal patrol, while No. 5 CDF
                                    took on strength a single
                                    D.H. 86 which it used to patrol the west of Cape Camorin and the Malabar Coast.

                                    Meanwhile the creation of a training structure in India became imperative and RAF
                                    flying
                                    instructors were
                                    assigned to flying clubs to instruct IAF Volunteer Reserve cadets on Tiger Moths.
                                    364
                                    pupils were to receive
                                    elementary flying training at seven clubs in British India and two in various
                                    princely States by the end of
                                    1941. Some comparative modernity was infused in August 1941, when No. 1 Squadron
                                    began conversion to the
                                    Westland Lysander at Drigh Road, the Unit being presented with a full establishment
                                    of 12 Lysanders at Peshawar
                                    by the Bombay War Gifts Fund in the following November. No. 2 Squadron had converted
                                    from the Wapiti to the
                                    Audax in September 1941 and, on 1 October No. 3 Squadron, similarly Audax-equipped,
                                    was raised at Peshawar.

                                    The IAF VR was now inducted into the regular IAF, the individual flights initially
                                    retaining their coastal
                                    defence status, but with Japan's entry into the war in December, No. 4 Flight, with
                                    four Wapitis and two
                                    Audaxes, was despatched to Burma to operate from Moulmein. Unfortunately, four of
                                    the flight's six aircraft
                                    were
                                    promptly lost to Japanese bombing and, late in January 1942, No. 4 Flight gave place
                                    in Moulmein to No. 3 Flight
                                    which had meanwhile re-equipped with four ex-RAF Blenheim ls. For a month, these
                                    Blenheims were to provide
                                    almost the sole air cover for ships arriving at Rangoon harbour.

                                    On 1 February 1942, No.1 Squadron arrived in Burma with its Lysanders, flying
                                    tactical
                                    recce missions from
                                    Toungoo before transferring to Mingaladon with a flight deployed at Lashio. IAF
                                    personnel were soon
                                    hanging pairs of 250-lb. bombs on each of their Lysanders and with these, flew
                                    low-level unescorted missions
                                    against the principal Japanese air bases at Mae-Haungsaun, Cheingmai and Chiangrai
                                    in Thailand. However, the
                                    Japanese advance was relentless and with the final evacuation of Burma, No.1
                                    Squadron personnel were flown
                                    to India, where at Risalpur in June 1942, the unit began conversion to the Hurricane
                                    IIB fighter. No.2
                                    Squadron had also equipped with Lysanders by the end of 1941, being confined to
                                    anti-invasion exercises
                                    until, in September 1942, it emulated the IAF's premier unit by converting to
                                    Hurricanes. The third IAF unit
                                    to operate the Lysander was No.4 Squadron, formed with four aircraft on 16 February
                                    1942. This squadron was
                                    to continue to operate the Westland aircraft until it, too was re-equipped with the
                                    Hurricane in June 1943.

                                    Six months earlier, No.6 Squadron was raised with personnel from Nos 1 and 2
                                    flights, being
                                    Hurricane-equipped from the outset. Between March and December 1942, 10 aircrew
                                    schools were opened in
                                    India, and the first Harvard Is and IIs were delivered to No. 1 Flying Training
                                    School at Ambala, this
                                    school having been established to provide basic and advanced training for IAF pilots
                                    over a four-and-half
                                    month course. By the end of that year, however,or a decade after the IAF's creation
                                    and three years into
                                    World War II, the Service could muster just five squadrons. The coastal defence
                                    flights had now been
                                    disbanded and most personnel of Nos.3 and 6 Flights were combined with regular IAF
                                    personnel to form No. 7
                                    Squadron which was equipped with the U:S. - built Vengeance 1 dive bomber in
                                    mid-February 1943. No. 8
                                    Squadron was raised meanwhile, on 1 December 1942, absorbing the remaining coastal
                                    defence flight personnel,
                                    and also issued with the Vengeance, to achieve operational status on 25June 1943.

                                    The Vengeance suffered numerous defects and teething troubles, necessitating
                                    temporary withdrawal from the
                                    two IAF squadrons, but the problems were eventually mitigated if not eradicated, and
                                    No. 8 Sqn flew its
                                    first operational Vengeance sorties against Japanese targets from Double Moorings,
                                    Chittagong, on 15
                                    December 1943, No. 7 Squadron, which had flown its Vengeances on some missions
                                    against dissident tribesmen
                                    in North Waziristan, started operations in the Arakan from an airstrip at Uderbund,
                                    near Kumbigram, where it
                                    arrived on 12 March 1944, the two squadrons converting to Vengeance IIIs during the
                                    course of operations and
                                    both flying with considerable distinction.No. 7 Squadron discarded its dive bombers
                                    in favour of Hurricane
                                    IIs for the tactical-reconnaissance role in November 1944, No. 8 Squadron becoming
                                    the first to convert onto
                                    the Spitfire VIII during the previous month and commencing operations on 3 January
                                    1945 in the Kangaw area.

                                    Both Nos 9 and 10 Squadrons were raised on Hurricanes in the early months of 1944,
                                    and thus, by the end of
                                    the year, the operational element of the IAF had risen to nine squadrons, with Nos.
                                    1,2,3,4,6,7,9 and 10 on
                                    Hurricanes and No.8 on Spitfires. Five of the Hurricane-equipped squadrons played a
                                    major role in the Arakan
                                    offensive which began in December 1944, disrupting the enemy's lines of
                                    communication and constantly
                                    harrying the Japanese forces until victory was achieved with the re-occupation of
                                    Rangoon on 3 May 1945. In
                                    that month, No. 4 Squadron became the second IAF Spitfire unit when it re-equipped
                                    with the Mk VIII version
                                    of this fighter, and No. 9 followed suit to complete conversion byJuly, by which
                                    time No. 10 had begun
                                    conversion, and the Hurricane, backbone of the IAF combat element for much of the
                                    war, was rapidly phased
                                    out.

                                    During the war years, the steady expansion of the IAF had placed all emphasis on
                                    army co-operation and
                                    tactical reconnaissance; it had continued to fly ageing equipment such as the

                                    The stimulus provided by the Second World War had raised RIAF personnel strength to
                                    28,500 including some
                                    1,600 officers, by the time hostilities terminated. In August 1945, No. 4 Squadron
                                    was
                                    designated a
                                    component unit of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan, exchanging
                                    its
                                    Spitfire Vllls for Mk
                                    XlVs in October and arriving in Japan aboard HMS vengence on 23 April 1946.
                                    Meanwhile,
                                    from late 1945,
                                    theremaining Hurricane-equipped RIAF fighter squadrons converted to the Spitfire at
                                    Kohat, Samungli and
                                    Risalpur and by mid-1946 the entire RIAF fighter force was Spitfire-equipped. The
                                    year
                                    1946 also saw the
                                    establishment of the first RIAF transport unit, No.12 Squadron which had first been
                                    raised on Spitfires at
                                    Kohat in December 1945 and received C-47 Dakotas in Panagarh in late 1946. A
                                    decision
                                    had also been taken to
                                    re-equip the fighter squadrons with the Tempest II, and implementation of this
                                    decision
                                    began during the
                                    autumn of 1946, No. 3 Squadron at Kolar becoming the first to re-equip, followed by
                                    No.10 Squadron later in
                                    1946.

                                    Personnel strength had meanwhile been virtually halved to some 14,000 officers and
                                    men
                                    in the post-war
                                    rundown, but the British authorities had made their own assessment of India's
                                    post-war
                                    defence needs. As of
                                    October 1946, they envisaged expansion of the existing ten RIAF squadrons into a
                                    balanced force of twenty
                                    fighter, bomber and transport squadrons. Owing to the rapidly changing political
                                    situation, however,
                                    definitive decisions concerning Indian defence were, in the event, to be left to the
                                    emerging Government of
                                    Independent India. No. 4 Squadron converted to the Tempest 11 upon its return to
                                    India
                                    from Japan and Nos.7
                                    and 8 Squadrons also relinquished their Spitfires for the more efficacious Tempest
                                    fighter during the summer
                                    of 1947. Nos. 1 and 9 Squadrons, too, received Tempest lls at this time, but on 15
                                    August 1947, and with the
                                    division of both India and its armed forces, these units stood down and their
                                    equipment
                                    was transferred to
                                    the newly created Royal Pakistan Air Force. Thus, the principal components of the
                                    RIAF
                                    at partition were
                                    Nos. 3,4,7,8 and 10 Squadrons with Tempest us, No. 2 Squadron with Spitfires and No.
                                    12
                                    Squadron with C-47s,
                                    plus No. 1 Air Observation Flight, the establishment of which with AOP Auster 4s,
                                    5s,
                                    and 6s, coincided with
                                    independence. No. 6 Squadron, which had been in process of converting from Spitfires
                                    to
                                    C-47s at Drigh Road,
                                    had been stood down and its transports transferred to Pakistan.

                                    The RIAF had lost many permanent bases and other establishments as a result of the
                                    division of the country,
                                    but was to have virtually no breathing space in which to recover from the surgery
                                    that
                                    had accompanied
                                    partition before the Service was to find itself once more firing its guns in
                                    earnest. On
                                    27 October 1947,
                                    No.12 Sqn was to initiate the remarkable feat of air-lifting the Ist Sikhs from
                                    Palam
                                    onto the rough and
                                    dusty Srinagar airstrip without planning or reconnaissance as the initial Indian
                                    response to the sizeable
                                    insurgent forces that were pouring across the border into Jammu and Kashmir. On 30
                                    October, the first
                                    Spitfires from the Advanced Flying School at Ambala reached Srinagar and were soon
                                    engaged in strafing the
                                    raiders beyond Pattan. Within a week, the Tempests of No. 7 Squadron were playing a
                                    decisive role in the
                                    battle of Shelatang which halted the forward momentum of the insurgents.

                                    The fighting was to continue for 15 months, with heavy RIAF involvement throughout,

                                    No. 2 Squadron had re-equipped with Spitfire XVllls in the interim, and No. 9
                                    Squadron re-raised on this
                                    type; No. 101 Photo Reconnaissance Flight was formed in January 1948 on Spitfire PR
                                    Mk. XlXs, this unit
                                    being destined to achieve full squadron status in April 1950. To make up attrition

                                    operations, a further batch of Tempest IIs was procured from the UK in December
                                    1948. The same year
                                    witnessed various equipment changes, one of which was to have a profound effect on
                                    the composition of the
                                    RIAF. The Service, wishing to establish a heavy bombing element, contracted with HAL
                                    to "re-construct" a
                                    force of B-24 Liberators from the mouldering remains of nearly 100 ex USAF bombers
                                    of this type at the

                                    Despite the scepticism on the part of the US and British advisers concerning the
                                    feasibility of the scheme,
                                    the first half-dozen HAL-reconditioned B-24s were ready by November 1948 and, on the

                                    5 Squadron was formed with these heavy bombers. Later, in early 1950, No. 6 Squadron
                                    was to re-form at Poona
                                    also with B-24s, while No.16 Squadron was to be established to provide back-up

                                    was concerned, was the arrival in India on 4 November 1948 of three Vampire F.Mk.3

                                    the precursors of more than 400 Vampires of various types that were procured by the

                                    In January 1950, India became a Republic within the British Commonwealth and the
                                    Indian Air Force dropped
                                    its "Royal" prefix. At this time, it possessed six fighter squadrons of Spitfires,
                                    Vampires and Tempests,
                                    operating from Kanpur, Poona, Ambala and Palam, one B-24 bomber squadron, one C-47

                                    squadron, one AOP flight, a communications squadron at Palam and a growing training
                                    organisation. Training
                                    adhered closely to the pattern established by the RAF, most instructors having
                                    graduated from the CFS in the
                                    UK and in addition to No.1. Flying Training School at Hyderabad with Tiger Moths and
                                    Harvards and No. 2 FTS
                                    atJodhpur with Prentices and Harvards, there were IAF colleges at Begumpet,
                                    Coimbatore andJodhpur. Licence
                                    manufacture of the de Havilland Vampire had been initiated by HAL which, after
                                    building a batch from
                                    imported major assemblies, went on to manufacture a further 250.

                                    In addition, 60 Vampire T Mk. 55s were to
                                    be built of which 10 were assembled from imported kits. Nos.2,3 and 8 Squadrons
                                    followed No.7 Squadron on
                                    the Vampire, but, extraordinarily, 1951 also saw the formation of the last
                                    piston-engined fighter combat
                                    unit when No. 14 Squadron was raised on the Spitfire Mk. XVIII. Vampire NF Mk. 54
                                    two-seat night fighters
                                    were obtained in May 1953 to re-equip No. 10. Sqn at Palam, thus endowing
                                    night-intercept capability upon
                                    the IAF for the first time. At this time, relations between India and Pakistan were
                                    again steadily
                                    deteriorating and the IAF, its combat strength virtually unchanged since partition
                                    in 1947, was scarcely
                                    ready for any full-scale conflict. Plans were accordingly framed for major expansion
                                    during the period
                                    1953-57, and the Government began to seek non-traditional and alternative sources of
                                    combat aircraft procurement.

                                    Selection of the Dassault Ouragan fighter from France at this time reflected the
                                    decision to initiate
                                    diversification of supply sources. The first four of over 100 Ouragans, or Toofanis
                                    as they were to become
                                    known in the IAF, reached Palam from France on 24 October 1953, and this type
                                    re-equipped Nos.8, 3 and 4
                                    Squadrons in that order. The Toofanis were eventually to be passed on to
                                    newly-raised units Nos. 29 and 47
                                    Squadrons, with the re-equipment in 1957 of Nos. 3 and 8 Squadrons with the Mystere
                                    IVA from the same Gallic

                                    Re-equipment of the combat units necessarily assumed an overriding priority in view
                                    of the growth of what
                                    were seen as threats to India's integrity, but expansion of airlift capability was
                                    also vital. A second
                                    transport squadron, No. 11, had been formed on C-47 Dakotas in September 1951, and
                                    considerable enhancement
                                    of the Service's logistic support capacity was heralded by procurement of 26
                                    Fairchild C-119G Packets from
                                    the United States which reached India by the end of 1954. Rapidly to assume the
                                    status of an airlift
                                    backbone, the C- 119Gs were issued to No. 12 Squadron, which, for some years,
                                    operated them in concert with
                                    the C-47s, the older transports eventually passing to a newly-raised unit, No. 43
                                    Squadron. A second batch
                                    of 29 C- 119Gs was obtained in July 1960, and the transport fleet was further
                                    augmented by another 24
                                    C-119Gs in May 1963 under US emergency military aid.

                                    Air Force took place in
                                    1955, two units of the latter being formed as Nos. 51 and 52 Squadrons at New Delhi
                                    and Bombay. A third AAF
                                    unit, No. 53 Sqn, was raised at Madras in the following year, and four more added

                                    The AAF squadrons were
                                    equipped with the HAL-designed HT-2 trainer - officially introduced into service on
                                    10 January 1955 - and

                                    Expansion and modernisation Particularly significant in IAF was the year 1957, which
                                    witnessed true
                                    beginnings of the major re-equipment programme that was to raise the Service fully
                                    to world standards.
                                    Deliveries began of 110 Dassault Mystere IVAs, carrying the service into the realms
                                    of transonic flight for
                                    the first time, and both Hawker Hunters and English Electric Canberras began to
                                    enter the IAF inventory. A
                                    new No. 1 Squadron was raised on the Mystere, the existing Vampire-equipped No. 1
                                    Squadron being
                                    redesignated as No. 27 Squadron; No. 5 Squadron re-equipped with the Canberra B(l)
                                    Mk. 58, and, at the
                                    year's end, No. 7 Squadron began conversion to the Hunter FMk.56. It was perhaps
                                    appropriate that the year
                                    which saw commencement of an immense infusion of modern hardware should also witness
                                    the end of the IAF's
                                    piston-engined fighter epoch: No. 14 Squadron, the last firstline piston-engined
                                    fighter unit, flew in its
                                    Spitfire Mk. XVllls to Halwara in preparation for re-equipment with the Vampire.

                                    The IAF's energies were now taxed heavily with implementation of an expansion
                                    programme aimed at raising the
                                    Service from a 15-squadron force to no fewer than 33 squadrons over an extremely
                                    short span of years: a
                                    Herculean task when performed simultaneously with sweeping equipment changes.
                                    Several new squadrons, such as
                                    Nos. 15, 17, 20, 24, 27 and 45, were raised on Vampire FB Mk. 52s as interim
                                    equipment; Canberra B(l) Mk.
                                    58s had equipped two additional squadrons, Nos. 16 and 35 by 1959, No. 106 Squadron
                                    having equipped with
                                    Canberra PR Mk. 57s and by the end of the 1961, six squadrons (Nos.7, 14, 17, 20, 27
                                    and 37) were equipped
                                    with the Hunter. Growth was not restricted to the combat elements for, in parallel,
                                    the IAF's transport
                                    force was enlarged to six squadrons, three with C-47s (Nos. 11, 43 and 49), two with
                                    C-119Gs (Nos. 12 and
                                    19) and one with DHC-3 Otters (No.41).

                                    The early sixties were accompanied by the IAF's induction of yet more new aircraft
                                    types, the most
                                    interesting of these arguably being the Folland Gnat lightweight fighter. With its
                                    startling agility, the
                                    Gnat proffered outstanding cost effectiveness and during the mid-fifties a licence
                                    agreement was concluded
                                    for its manufacture by HAL following delivery of 23 complete aircraft and 20 sets of
                                    components by the
                                    parent company. The first IAF unit, No. 23 Squadron, converted from the Vampire FB
                                    Mk. 52 to the Gnat in
                                    March 1960. No. 2 Squadron re-equipped with the Gnat at Ambala early in 1962, and
                                    No.9 Squadron soon
                                    followed suit.

                                <p>MONUC was the third major contribution of the IAF under UN flag. As the situation in
                                    North-East Congo was turning grave with repeated massacres and killings of innocent
                                    civilians; international community decided to strengthen its military presence.
                                    India contributed armed helicopters and utility helicopters in the Congolese
                                    provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. The IAF unit in Goma/Bunia was called the Indian
                                    Aviation Contingent (IAC-I) and the major lodger units included one Mi-25 Squadron
                                    and one Mi-17 squadron. These squadrons were equipped with four Mi-25 aircraft and
                                    five Mi-17 helicopters respectively along with aircrew and ground support personnel.
                                    This invaluable asset increased the MONUC's sphere of influence in the Eastern DRC
                                    and UN forces were been able to reach areas that had hitherto been outside its
                                    sphere of influence. In addition to this enhancement of sphere of operation, the
                                    arrival of IAC 1, followed by IAC2 and 3 also conferred upon MONUC a high degree of
                                    firepower both in North Kivu and Ituri province. This firepower in turn conferred
                                    upon MONUC an ability to deter various rebel groups who now feared retribution from
                                    the skies.

                                    The first time when an IAF squadron was led in the volatile situation of Congo was
                                    in the sixties. The unit had six Canberra B (I) MK-58 fighter aircraft with aircrew
                                    and ground support personnel. The Squadron was commanded by Wing Commander AIK
                                    Suares. India inducted these aircraft through a long haul over the Gulf countries
                                    and Africa commencing their long flights from Agra on 09 Oct 1961.

                                    After arriving at Congo, the Canberra team started their mission by adopting an
                                    intensive flying programme. The Squadron was given its area of responsibility over
                                    southern Katanga province aligned with the Indian forces. The Canberras practiced
                                    low level (500 feet) and night flying over the area of operations. This also enabled
                                    the UN to show their robust presence with a show of UN flag.

                                    In August 1961, the Indian Brigade Group had launched 'Operation RUMPUNCH' against
                                    the foreign mercenaries creating law and order problems in Katanga province. These
                                    mercenaries were instrumental in declaration of secession of this province and
                                    creating an impasse in the peace process. The Canberras started their operations in
                                    1961 by attacking and destroying certain mercenary position in strategically
                                    significant town of Kolwezi. The rebels had a substantial air element comprised of
                                    old aircraft which posed a great danger to UN freedom of movement in the area. The
                                    Squadron was given the task to locate and destroy this element. IAF operations
                                    commenced in Leopoldville and Kamina and within a short time rebel air forces were
                                    incapacitated. The Canberras repeatedly raided Katangan targets and were
                                    instrumental in providing much needed long range fire support to the UN ground
                                    forces. At times the targets were at a distance of 1000 km with an intense cloud
                                    cover over the way points. The Indian pilots used many ingenious methods to lead
                                    themselves to the targets. They intensively used a lake, which was a prominent mark
                                    to the west of Kolwezi and then used good old map reading over the final leg to the
                                    airfield, using the Green Satin airborne navigation aid.

                                    Wing Commander Suares was the first to carry out the daring yet risky engagement
                                    profile using 20 mm cannon. This was followed by another attack by Flight Lieutenant
                                    Gautam, thus destroying the Fouga Magister aircraft. By the efforts of these two
                                    officers, the IAF was able to establish a near air supremacy over the skies of
                                    Elizabethville and Kamina.

                                    Wing Commander Suares and his team persisted with their offensive air support over
                                    Kolwezi, based on the requirements of UN forces in the area. After locating rebel
                                    positions, the Squadron carried out a show of force by low level flying over the
                                    main target area and also engaged the rebels with cannon fire. After testing rebel
                                    reaction capability, a deliberate offensive action was taken by Flight Lieutenant
                                    Dushyant Singh, who raided the rebel hideout in a post office area. The Canberras
                                    were welcomed by a strong anti-aircraft firing from the rebels. The distraction by
                                    the leading aircraft allowed other Canberras in the same attack to destroy road
                                    convoys, ammunition dumps and other key locations captured by the rebel forces. In
                                    the weeks following these attacks, the Squadron made many such operational sorties
                                    around Elizabethville. In the next few weeks, the Canberras also carried out armed
                                    reconnaissance sorties, engaging rebel lines of communications. The Squadron had an
                                    added capacity of photo reconnaissance, which was made full use of by the ground
                                    forces. This included both photographic and visual reports on the conditions of
                                    bridges in rebel held territory; movement of the rebel forces and their
                                    concentrations.

                                    Further procurement source diversification had been signified late in 1960 when, as
                                    a
                                    result of the
                                    increasing frequency of clashes with Chinese forces on the Sino-lndian Himalayan
                                    border
                                    and the need that
                                    these revealed for yet further increase in airlift capability, together with a
                                    requirement for medium
                                    helicopters suitable for high-altitude operation, orders were placed in the Soviet
                                    Union
                                    for eight Antonov
                                    An- 12B and 24 Ilyushin Il- 14 transport aircraft plus 10 Mi-4 helicopters. The
                                    first
                                    An-12B arrived in
                                    India on 1 March 1961, No. 44 Squadron being formed on this type, the 11-14s that
                                    followed equipping another
                                    newly-raised squadron, No. 42. A follow-on order for a further eight An-12Bs was
                                    placed
                                    early in 1962, the
                                    IAF finally beginning to build up a really credible heavy airlift capability which
                                    was
                                    to be immensely
                                    enhanced with the arrival of a further 25 An-12Bs under a loan agreement signed in
                                    July
                                    1963, a second

                                    The Mi-4 helicopter was to have as profound an effect on IAF capability as did the
                                    An-12B. Prior to the
                                    phase-in on this Soviet type, the Service had but a handful of ageing Sikorsky
                                    S-55s,
                                    plus a number of small

                                    inventory began. No.109
                                    Helicopter Unit was formed with the first Mi-4s and following an order for further

                                    There could, of course, be no abatement in equipment modernisation. While the
                                    Indo-Pakistan conflict had
                                    underlined the vital importance of the state or readiness of the men flying and
                                    servicing the aircraft,
                                    their training and motivation, the efficacy of their equipment was of equal concern.
                                    When the September 1965
                                    hostilities began, the MiG-21 had still to achieve operational status. No. 28
                                    Squadron
                                    had been formed on
                                    the MiG-21 clear-weather day intercept model but was still very much a trials unit
                                    then
                                    flying localised
                                    CAPs. Early acquisition of MiG-21s of a later and more potent version was considered
                                    essential to accelerate
                                    re-equipment of squadrons still flying such patently obsolete types as the Vampire
                                    FBMk.52. Thus sufficient
                                    numbers of the improved MiG-21FL (Type 77 in IAF parlance) were imported in flyaway
                                    condition to initiate
                                    the programme, and these, together with others imported in CKD form for HAL
                                    assembly,
                                    were to be sufficient
                                    for the re-equipment of nine squadrons during the period 1966-69.

                                    Owing to the success enjoyed by the Gnat during the conflict, plans for its

                                    halted and production was fully reinstated, to result in a further four Gnat

                                    (Nos 15, 21, 22 and

                                    were equipped with the Hunter, a further four on the MiG-21FL and two on the Mystere
                                    IVA. Two squadrons
                                    fulfilled the photo-recce fighter role with adapted Vampire T Mk. 55s and one

                                    was in process of converting from the C-47 to the HS. 748. The AOP squadrons
                                    operated a
                                    mix of Auster AOP-9s
                                    and HAL-designed HAOP-27 Krishaks, and the Helicopter Units, which were not formed

                                    were equipped with the Mi-4 and the Alouette 111 (Chetak). As the sixties translated

                                    By the mid '70s, the IAF was clearly in need of urgent re-equipment decisions and

                                    better known by their acronyms DPSA, TASA, METAC and HETAC, were pursued and
                                    decisions were forthcoming at

                                    1978-88 witnessing a major
                                    modernisation programme which replaced most of the earlier generation and obsolete
                                    equipment with spanking
                                    new aircraft types and weapon systems. No less than twenty new aircraft types and

                                    First off the mark was selection of the Jaguar strike fighter, to meet the IAF's
                                    urgent Deep Penetration
                                    Strike Aircraft (DPSA) requirement, to replace the Canberra and Hunter still

                                    role. After many years of evaluation and negotiation, the Anglo-French fighter was
                                    contracted for, an
                                    interim batch of ex-RAF Jaguars being accepted to re-equip No. 14 Squadron. IAF
                                    pilots and technicians
                                    received conversion training with the RAF and British Aerospace in Lossiemouth,
                                    Coltishall and Warton before
                                    ferrying the first Jaguars to India in July 1979. These were followed by a batch of
                                    U.K. built Jaguars to
                                    re-equip No. 5 Squadron even as simultaneously, HAL prepared for production of the
                                    aircraft, its
                                    powerplants, avionics and accessories in India. By the mid-80s, the Jaguar was in
                                    service with Nos. 5, 14,
                                    16 and 27 Squadrons while a flight of No.6 Squadron was equipped with the Maritime

                                    generation Sea Eagle anti-ship sea-skimming missile. The Jaguar strike fighter was
                                    equipped also with Magic

                                    Meanwhile, in 1976, the "third generation" MiG-21bis, considered the definitive
                                    variant of the classic
                                    tailed-delta fighter design, was to follow-on the "M" sub-type, as a multi-role air
                                    superiority/ground
                                    attack version. The MiG-21bis assumed the prime air defence mantle and sufficient
                                    numbers were acquired in
                                    1976-77 to equip three squadrons (Nos. 15, 21 and 23) formerly operating the Gnat
                                    light fighter. With some
                                    580 MiG-21s delivered by HAL and nearly 250 MiG-21s (including the two-seat
                                    operational trainers) imported
                                    as "fly aways", the type remained an immense asset for the Indian Air Force for over
                                    a quarter century. The
                                    quantity vs. quality dilemma inevitably faced by most of the world's air forces as a
                                    consequence of
                                    spiralling costs was mitigated for the IAF by the large scale availability of the
                                    MiG-21, which type will
                                    surely go down as one of aviation history's all-time classics.

                                    The next requirement to be met was for a Tactical Air Strike Aircraft (TASA). With
                                    the various development
                                    programmes to enhance the operational performance of the HF-24 Marut by HAL
                                    abandoned for one reason or the
                                    other, the Government of India concluded an agreement with the Soviet Union for the
                                    MiG-23 variable-sweep
                                    fighter. Four squadrons, then flying the HF-24 and Sukhoi Su-7 were re-equipped with
                                    the MiG-23BN and
                                    induction into IAF service of this swing-wing fighter. Nos. 10 and 220 Squadrons
                                    were shortly operational on
                                    the new type and Nos. 31 and 221 followed to add a considerable measure of potency
                                    to the offensive air
                                    support formations of the IAF. The dedicated strike derivative, selected for licence
                                    production by HAL, was
                                    the MiG-27M which shared the overall configuration of the BN but was optimised for
                                    low-level, high-speed
                                    performance. The last Sukhoi Su-7 Squadron (No.222) became the first MiG-27M unit
                                    and the Ajeet light
                                    fighter squadrons were gradually re-equipped with the MiG-27ML, No.9 being followed
                                    by Nos.18,22 and lately,
                                    No.2.

                                    Induction of the new generation F-16 fighter by the PAF in 1981-82 was a "dejavu"
                                    type situation for India
                                    and in order to counter such a challenge, the Government contracted for the MiG-23MF
                                    air superiority version
                                    of the swing-wing fighter, equipped with beyond-visual range missiles, and two new
                                    squadrons (Nos. 223 and
                                    224) were formed on the type in 1982. However, these were considered only an interim
                                    solution and, in the
                                    absence of suitable, known, Soviet equivalents, India turned to Western sources for
                                    an advanced technology
                                    interceptor. In 1982, a contract was finalised with France for the Mirage 2000
                                    delta-wing, fly-by-wire
                                    fighter, with high agility and a formidable radar/missile combination. IAF pilots
                                    and technicians had
                                    converted to the Mirage 2000 at Mont de Marsan and ferried the fighters from France
                                    in the summer of 1985.
                                    Two squadrons (Nos. 1 and 7) were re-equipped with the new French fighter in 1985-86
                                    and the Indian Air
                                    Force employed this multi-role advanced technology fighter to good effect in a
                                    number of actions within the
                                    next few years.

                                    Not too long afterwards, the Indian Air Force was, to be pleasantly surprised when
                                    its test pilots were
                                    invited to evaluate the Soviet Union's latest, still-under-wraps, air superiority
                                    fighter, vaguely known to
                                    the public as the Fulcrum. Officially designated the MiG-29, the IAF team was
                                    obviously delighted by the new
                                    generation fighter's performance and handling qualities, described as "truly
                                    outstanding". Two years were to
                                    pass, however, before the Governments of India and the Soviet Union formalised an
                                    agreement for supply of
                                    the MiG-29, integrated with contemporary pulse doppler radar and new weapon systems.
