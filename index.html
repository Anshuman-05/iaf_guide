        <div class=intro>
            <p class="lead">
                The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its complement of personnel and
                aircraft assets ranks fourth amongst the air forces of the world. Its primary mission is to secure
                Indian
                airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflict. It was officially established on 8 October
                1932 as an
                auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honoured India's aviation service during World War II
                with
                the prefix Royal. After India gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian
                Air
                Force
                was kept and served in the name of Dominion of India. With the government's transition to a Republic in
                1950, the prefix Royal was removed.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Since 1950 the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with the People's
                Republic
                of China. Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot,
                Operation
                Cactus and Operation Poomalai. The IAF's mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the
                IAF
                participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                IAF today is the fourth largest air force in the world. It is among the world’s top ten
                countries in terms of defense expenditure and third-largest importer of defense hardware.
                IAF is focusing on the procurement of long range, lethal and precision guided munitions,
                reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition system.

            <h2>INDIAN AIR FORCE CREST</h2>
            <img src="iaf_crest.png" alt="IAF Logo" id=crest height=300 width=250 title="IAF Crest">
            <p class="lead">
                Crests have been used for the purpose of recognition and distinguishing formations or Units.
                They are symbols and source of inspiration and encouragement for the soldiers. The Air Force has adopted
                various crests for the commands, Squardron and the other establishments. The Crests in the Indian Air
                Force comprises of a standard frame. The central portion of the frame contains the individual formation
                sign with a motto shown in the scroll at the foot of the frame. The unit sign is drawn inside a circle
                of 3 inches diameter. The name of the formation of the units is shown in the upper half of the circle
                while Bhartiya Vayu Sena inscribed in the lower half. The crest and the motto are designed based on the
                role of the formation. The Crest is approved by the President of India and is of great historical and
                sentimental value. The Crest is normally presented by the AOsC-in-C at ceremonial parades. The
                importance of the crest can be understood from the fact that the movement of the crest from one place to
                other is done only by hand of an officer.

                The Motto of Indian Air Force has been taken from eleventh chapter of the Gita, the Discourse
                given by Lord Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra during the Great War of Mahabharata.
                The
                Lord is showing His Supreme Divine form to Arjuna and the great form of the Lord is reaching the sky
                with
                glory, evoking fear and loss of self-control in the mind of Arjuna. <strong>The Indian Air Force,
                    similarly,
                    aims to
                    overwhelm the adversaries with application of aerospace power in defence of the nation.</strong>
