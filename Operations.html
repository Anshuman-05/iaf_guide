        <h2 class=mainheading>OPERATIONS</h2><br>
        <p>Indian Air Force is known for its strategic planning and have bagged numerous success stories and
            honour and respect from various nations abroad. Their leadership activities and goodwill motto to maintain
            peace and security have been the prime factor to be one among the best. Since times immemorial, the IAF
            has proved that they are very efficient and are strong enough and we can happily live and breathe in this
            nation. Giving supreme sacrifices, many warriors have taught us that nation is above everything. Here is a
            list of some of the most important operations conducted by the IAF, somewhere even the
            army and paramilitary was also joined in to carry out of missions.

                    <h3>Background</h3>

                    <ul class="bulletText">
                        <li>India gained Independence at mid-night on 14/15 Aug 1947 but at the cost of its partition on
                            the
                            basis of religion. As per Independence of India Act passed by the British Parliament,
                            various
                            subordinate princely states of the British Indian Empire had two options :
                            <ol>
                                <li>To join either India or Pakistan.</li>
                                <li>To opt forIndependence.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>The Maharaja of Kashmir, with its border contiguous to both India and Pakistan, had plans to
                            opt
                            forIndependence. Once it became clear to Pakistan that the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir was
                            not
                            going to accede to Pakistan, Pakistan permitted her tribesmen led by her Army officers in
                            civilian garb to cross over into Kashmir on 22 Oct 1947 to loot and plunder the Kashmiris.
                            The
                            tribesmen were well armed with automatic weapons, mortars and flame-throwers. The Maharaja
                            of
                            Kashmir, on 24 Oct 1947, requested the Indian Government for military aid. Indian Government
                            conveyed to the Maharaja that it would be legitimate to send the Indian troops
                            to&nbsp;Kashmir
                            only after Kashmir is formally acceded to India. By 26<sup>th</sup> Oct, Kashmir looked
                            indefensible and Pak militiamen were knocking at the doors of Srinagar and were just 50 km
                            away.
                            At this late stage, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir signed the Instrument of Accession. J
                            &amp; K acceded to India on 27 Oct 1947 and the unprepared Indian military got sucked into a
                            war.</li>

                        <li>After the signing of the Instrument of Accession, it became the duty of Royal Indian Army
                            and
                            Royal Indian Air Force to defend the territorial integrity of&nbsp;India. The Union Cabinet
                            tasked General Sir Rob Lockhart, the Commander in Chief of the Royal Indian Army and Air
                            Marshal
                            Sir Thomas W Elmhirst, the Commander in Chief of the Royal Indian Air Force to liberate the
                            state of&nbsp;Jammu and Kashmirfrom the intruders. The total aircraft strength of the RIAF
                            at
                            that time was as follows :
                            <ol>
                                <li>Six Squadrons of Tempest fighter bomber aircraft with eight aircraft per squadron.
                                </li>
                                <li>One Squadron of Dakota light transport aircraft with seven aircraft.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Twenty Spitfire fighter aircraft.</li>
                        <li>One Flight of Harvard fighter with four aircraft.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3 class=midheads>Tactical Constraints in Positioning the Troops</h3>

                    <p>The only all weather road link to the Kashmir Valley was through Rawalpindi and Murre in West
                        Punjab
                        and fair weather road link was through Rajauri, Punch and Uri after passing through the Haji Pir
                        pass, portions of which were already under control of militiamen. The road link through Banihal
                        was
                        bad. Induction of Army by road would have taken long time and not served the purpose of
                        savingSrinagar&nbsp;from the fast advancing militiamen. The only viable option was to airlift
                        troops
                        to&nbsp;Srinagarbefore the militiamen over run the Airfield.</p>

                    <h3 class=midheads>Air Bridge to Srinagar</h3>

                    <p>The airstrips at Jammu and Srinagar were made for the small light personal aircraft of the
                        Maharaja
                        and were short and unpaved. There were no navigational aids, landing aids, fire fighting
                        facilities
                        or proper refuelling facilities available either at&nbsp;Jammu&nbsp;or at Srinagar. The high
                        mountain ranges ofHimalayas were often covered with clouds and had to be negotiated by the
                        Dakota
                        aircraft with limited ceiling and negligible navigational aids. Each take off and landing would
                        raise a cloud of dust from the unpaved airstrip and reduce the visibility further. The airlift
                        requirements demanded landing / take off of aircraft in quick succession leaving hardly any time
                        for
                        dust to settle.</p>

                    <h3 class=midheads>The First Sorties</h3>

                    <p>The Government wasnt sure if the airfield at Srinagar was occupied by the militiamen or not. The
                        mission order had an unusual rider attached to it i.e. " To reconnoitre from the air and return
                        to
                        Jammu if the raiders have occupied the airstrip". The first three Dakotas of No 12 Sqn RIAF took
                        off
                        from Willingdon (Safdarjung) airfield at 0500h on 27 Oct 1947 with troops of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Sikh
                        Regiment ex-Gurgaon. The first aircraft touched down at 0830h, within hours of the signing of
                        the
                        Instrument of Accession and just in time to save the Srinagar airstrip and the city from being
                        overrun by the militiamen.</p>

                    <h3 class=midheads>Air Lift of an Infantry Brigade</h3>

                    <p>An Infantry Brigade was to be airlifted to Srinagar. The Dakotas did the transportation while
                        Tempests, Spitfires and even Harvards provided the necessary Close Air Support to the Army. Even
                        help of Airlines, their pilots and ground crew was requisitioned and they rose to the occasion
                        and
                        did a magnificent job. Air Cmde Mehar Singh, AOC Operational Group, with his professional acumen
                        accomplished the uphill task in record time of five days. Lord Mountbatten acknowledged this
                        achievement of RIAF saying that in all his experience of South East Asia Command and Over the
                        Hump
                        Flights to China, he had never known such an airlift being affected at such a short notice.</p>

                    <h3 class=midheads>Air Bridge to Poonch</h3>

                    <p>In the Poonch Sector along the Pakistan-Kashmir border, the Indian troops had taken up tactical
                        positions in the important towns along the Jammu-Srinagar Highway at Sunderbani, Naushera,
                        Borripatam, Bhimber, Mirpur, Kothi, Rajouri and Poonch. They were constantly being troubled by
                        the
                        invaders who had entrenched themselves in the hills. The Indian Army had a great problem at
                        their
                        hands i.e. provisioning of supplies not only for the troops but also for the forty thousand
                        refugees. With the road link to Jammu under threat of being cut off, the only option was an air
                        bridge to Poonch but there was no landing ground there. A decision was taken to construct an
                        emergency airstrip at Poonch. Six thousand refugees worked day and night and constructed an
                        airstrip
                        within a record time of one week. AVM Subroto Mukherjee and Air Cmde Mehar Singh landed the
                        first ac
                        on the newly constructed airstrip at Poonch on 8<sup>th</sup> Dec 1947. The landing and take off
                        at
                        Poonch was not easy as the Airstrip was surrounded by streams from three sides and the approach
                        was
                        extremely steep. Despite these difficulties and against heavy odds Air Cmde Mehar Singh created
                        a
                        sort of record by landing a Dakota with three tons of load against normal rated load of one ton.
                        In
                        a span of six days, No 12 Sqn RIAF carried out 73 sorties, averaging more than two sorties per
                        aircraft per day, carrying more than 210 tons of supplies to Poonch and evacuating thousands of
                        refugees during the return journey. The air bridge to Poonch was maintained for one year till
                        the
                        declaration of ceasefire on 01 Jan 1950.</p>

                    <h3 class=midheads>Spitfire Fighter Operations</h3>

                    <p>Spitfires from Advanced Flying School Ambala were inducted at Srinagar on 30<sup>th</sup> Oct
                        1947
                        and were soon engaged in strafing of intruders beyond Pattan. During the first week of Nov 1947,
                        the
                        enemy was able to close in undetected as much as upto half a mile from the Srinagar airfield
                        when
                        the fighters spotted the enemy concentration. After that the enemy was strafed so thoroughly
                        that it
                        broke the backbone of their resistance. This engagement was the turning point as it removed the
                        immediate threat to Srinagar airfield and brought a successful close of the first phase of
                        campaign.
                        Notable among the Spitfire pilots was Fg Offr Dilbag Singh who subsequently rose to the rank of
                        Air
                        Chief Marshal and retired as the Chief of Air Staff.</p>

                    <h3 class=midheads>Tempest Fighter Bomber Operations</h3>

                    <p>Within a week of the commencement of air operations, Tempests of No 7 Sqn RIAF ex-Ambala were
                        playing
                        a decisive role in the battle of Shelatang checking the advance of Militiamen. The Tempests were
                        involved in repeated attacks and tactical recee missions over Naushera, Poonch, Rajouri, Jhangar
                        and
                        Handover areas causing heavy damage to enemy strongholds. The strikes over vital enemy
                        strongholds
                        at Pilandri, Domel and Kishan Ganga bridge had effectively stopped the enemy troop movements and
                        literally paralysed them.</p>

                    <h3 class=midheads>Air Bridge to Leh</h3>

                    <ul class="bulletText">
                        <li>District of Ladakh with HQ at Leh is a high altitude desert with stark barren land East of
                            Kashmir. There were small villages along the river Indus. During the spring of 1948, the
                            invaders captured Skardu Fort and cut off the road link from Srinagar to Leh. The garrison
                            at
                            Leh was too weak in numbers and armament stores to offer any meaningful resistance to the
                            invaders and was poised to be overrun. Maj Gen KS Thimayya, GOC 19 Div had realised that the
                            only way to save Leh was to augment supplies through the air. Landing a low ceiling aircraft
                            like Dakota at such high altitude after negotiating Himalayan mountain ranges, was the
                            greatest
                            challenge any pilot could have thought of.</li>

                        <li>24<sup>th</sup> May 1948 was a historic day in the history of Indian Air Force when Air Cmde
                            Mehar Singh, with Maj Gen Thimayya as passenger, led a flight of Six Dakotas of 12 Sqn RIAF
                            across the high mountain ranges of Himalayas, towering up to 24, 000 feet negotiating the
                            Zojila
                            and Fatula Passes and landed at an improvised sandy airstrip next to the Indus river at a
                            height
                            of 11, 540 feet. Air Cmde Mehar Singh in his ancient Dakota didn't have the luxury of
                            de-icing
                            equipment, cabin pressurisation or route maps. A big airlift was called for to save Leh but
                            the
                            weather wouldn't co-operate and no airlift could take place for the next three days. From
                            28<sup>th</sup> May 1948 onwards, braving all odds, No 12 Sqn flew in soldiers armed with
                            arms
                            and ammunition, food supplies, tentage equipment and medical stores before the enemy arrived
                            i.e. after three days. No 12 Sqn flew 700 sorties and airlifted 1000 tons of stores during
                            the
                            air bridge operations to Leh from Srinagar.</li>

                    <ul class="bulletText">
                        <li>The large scale operations in Jammu and Kashmir were planned, directed and conducted almost
                            entirely by Indian officers. The few British officers still holding some senior appointments
                            in&nbsp;Indiagave some advice and assistance only in the first few months of the operations.
                            The
                            Indian officers of whom Cariappa was the senior most, had till then little experience in the
                            higher planning and conduct of war. It is a remarkable evidence of their high calibre and
                            professional competence that they managed so well the long compaign which took place in
                            exceptionally difficult circumstances.</li>
                        <li>As already related, there had been no previous planning at all for any military action in
                            J&amp;K. The first troops were flown to&nbsp;Srinagar&nbsp;with hardly a couple of days
                            planning
                            and preparation. During the long campaign, the small RIAF lost a total of 32 officers and
                            men
                            who laid down their lives for the nation during these operations. In this roll of honour,
                            there
                            were no less than 9 officers. The enemy casualties were definitely many times the total of
                            Indian Army and RIAF casualties, and one estimate concluded that the enemy suffered 20,000
                            casualties, including 6,000 killed.</li>
                        <li>RIAF's contribution to the success of the J&amp;K operations cannot be over emphasised and
                            it
                            was the one weapon to which the enemy had no answer. Only the impromptu air lift
                            to&nbsp;Srinagar&nbsp;in October 1947, saved the&nbsp;Kashmir&nbsp;Valley. A hundred planes
                            landed every day on the improvised airfield atSrinagar, bringing in troops, ammunition and
                            supplies and evacuating casualties and the refugees. The Air Force and civilian pilots of
                            these&nbsp;Dakotas&nbsp;defied the mountains, the weather, and fatigue to continue the
                            airlift
                            till the valley was saved. Leh and the entire Ladakh region was saved by Air Cmde Mehar
                            Singh
                            and his gallant boys; Mehar Singh himself landing the first Dakota at the hastily prepared
                            and
                            untested air strip at Leh. Flight Lieutenant DE Pushong similarly landed the first Dakota at
                            Punch, and made almost a hundred landings thereafter, bringing in, often under enemy
                            shelling,
                            the urgently needed 25 pounder gun and essential supplies. Sqn Ldr VP Hegde, Flight
                            Lieutenant
                            LS Grewal and Flight Lieutenant DN Ghadiok were among the many other transport pilots who
                            supplied the hard-pressed garrisons in Punch, Tithwal, Dras, Kargil, Leh etc. in innumerable
                            sorties, in spite of getting hit many times by enemy ground fire. They all received the Vir
                            Chakra award for their skill, dedication and gallantry.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>In the close support role, intrepid fighter pilots like Sqn Ldr D Subia and Sqn Ldr RS
                            Kalavaniwala accurately and repeatedly attacked enemy positions at Gurais, Zoji La, Pindras,
                            Rajauri etc., winning many Vir Chakra awards. One can well imagine the skill and courage
                            required to hit pin-point targets, among high hills and deep valleys, in the face of heavy
                            machine gun fire. Though Skardu could not be maintained by air supply and fell after six
                            months
                            of siege when ammunition was totally exhausted, and tough inclement weather over the high
                            hills
                            sometimes kept the planes grounded, the overall performance of the RIAF was superb indeed.
                            Not
                            only Air Cmde Mehar Singh, the AOC of No. 1 Group RIAF controlling all the air operations in
                            J
                            &amp; K, but also Wg Cdr MM Engineer, Wg Cdr H Moolgavkar and Wg Cdr SB Noronha were
                            honoured
                            with the MVC for this superb performance and their vitally important contribution to it. The
                            RIAF won, in all, four Maha Vir Chakra and 28 Vir Chakra awards in operations in J &amp; K
                            in
                            1947-48.</li>
                        <li>Apart from the Army and the Air Force, even civilians acted like heroes in these operations.
                            The
                            dedication and skill of the civilian pilots flying to&nbsp;Srinagar&nbsp;in October 1947
                            have
                            already been noted. But, few might be aware that a civilian Dhobi (Washerman), Ram Chander,
                            won
                            a MVC for rescuing an officer wounded during an ambush, shooting down several enemy troops
                            in
                            the process. Another civilian, a porter named M. Ismail, also won a MVC for similar heroism
                            on
                            the Zoji La front, while another porter Zuma Mohammad received the Vir Chakra for saving the
                            life of Lt Col MM Khanna when he was severely wounded in an enemy ambush near Pandu.</li>
                        <li>Thus in the very first military campaign forced on India after her Independence and
                            Partition,
                            her totally unprepared armed forces and many civilians gave an account of themselves of
                            which
                            any Nation may feel proud. Her good old sword, the world saw, was still not rusted. And this
                            ancient land of sages was also the land of heroes.&nbsp;</li>

                        The real test of IAF airlift capability came in October 1962, when open warfare erupted on the
                        Sino-lndian
                        border. During the period 20 October to 20 November, pressure on the Service's transport and
                        helicopter
                        units were intense, troops and supplies having to be flown to the support of the border posts
                        virtually
                        around the clock and at extreme altitudes. The helicopters had to constantly run the gauntlet of
                        Chinese
                        small arms and anti-aircraft fire, while operating to.the tricky helipads in the mountains. Many
                        notable
                        feats were performed by the IAF during this conflict, including the operation of C-119Gs from
                        airstrips
                        17,000 ft (5180m) above sea level in the Karakoram Himalayas, and the air-lifting by An-12Bs of
                        two troops
                        of AMX-13 light tanks to Chushul, in Ladakh, where the small airstrip was 15,000 ft (4570m)
                        above sea level.

                        The state of emergency declared as a result of the Sino-lndian fighting resulted in disbandment
                        of the
                        Auxillary Air Force and absorption of its personnel and equipment by the regular IAF. An
                        emergency training
                        scheme was instituted in which the services of five flying clubs at Madras, Kanpur, New Delhi,
                        Nagpur and
                        Patiala were enlisted, more than 1,000 cadets receiving primary flying instruction with these
                        clubs by the
                        end of 1964. Furthermore, Vampire FBMk.52s "mothballed" since 1961, were restored to service as
                        the
                        equipment of newly-raised squadrons.

                        The IAF was expanding rapidly, its personnel strength of 28,000 officers and men at the time of
                        the
                        Sino-lndian conflict increasing by some two-thirds by the end of 1964, but the manpower
                        requirements of the
                        33-squadron force had still to be implemented fully when the scheme was overtaken by even more
                        ambitious
                        expansion to a 45-squadron force which was sanctioned by the Government in October 1962, this
                        calling for
                        the raising of IAF personnel strength to some 100,000 by the early seventies.

                        119Gs from the USA, the IAF began to receive the Canadian DHC-4 Caribou, two being presented to
                        the Service
                        by the Canadian Government as assistance in wake of the Sino-lndian conflict and 16 more being

                        An epoch-making decision was taken in August 1962 which was to profoundly alter the complexion
                        and strength
                        of the Indian Air Force into the decades ahead. The Government of India signed protocols with
                        the Soviet
                        Union for the very first supply of combat aircraft and missiles for the Indian Air Force. The
                        purchase of 12
                        MiG-21 fighters from the Soviet Union - the IAF's first combat aircraft of non-western origin -
                        and for
                        Soviet technical assistance in setting up production facilities for the fighter in India was
                        followed by the
                        procurement of SA-2 (Dvina) surface-to-air missiles. Re-equipment and expansion of the IAF was
                        now being
                        pursued in parallel with major changes in the operational infrastructure. Prior to the
                        Sino-lndian conflict,
                        the IAF had been geared to provide defence against attack from the West only, but appreciation
                        of the
                        vulnerability of the entire Northern and Eastern border had called for profound rethinking of
                        the
                        operational infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="last">
                        It was now patently apparent that, for a country of the immensity of India, a system of purely
                        functional
                        Commands was impracticable and that, to cater for all potential-threats, operational command
                        would in
                        future, have to be exercised on a regional basis. Thus the Indian periphery was divided into
                        three for
                        purposes of operational control, the Western, Central and Eastern Air Commands eventually
                        emerging. However,
                        in order to maintain uniform standards in training and maintenance, the Training and Maintenance
                        Commands
                        were to remain functional.

                        Tension between India and Pakistan had steadily escalated over the years, culminating on 1
                        September
                        1965 in
                        a massive attack in the Chhamb sector by Pakistani forces. Possessing the initiative in having
                        chosen the
                        time and place to strike and enjoying overwhelming numerical superiority in the sector in both
                        armour and
                        troops, Pakistan posed a grave threat to Indian forces on the ground and so, in response to
                        urgent
                        requests
                        for air strikes against Pakistani armour advancing in the Chhamb-Jaurian sector, Vampire
                        FBMk.52s of
                        No. 45
                        Squadron, at the time undergoing operational training at a forward base, mounted their first
                        sorties
                        at 1745
                        hours on the first day of the conflict, and on their heels came the Mysteres of Nos.3 and 31
                        Squadrons
                        operating from Pathankot. The Pakistani armoured thrust was staggered. IAF Gnats proved their
                        mettle
                        in
                        shooting down PAF Sabres in this sector, the first of aerial victories being notched by Nos. 23
                        and
                        9
                        Squadrons. Rapidly escalating, full scale warfare broke out on 6 September all along the
                        international
                        border between West Pakistan and India.

                        In the days that followed, IAF Canberras raided the major PAF bases at Sargodha and Chaklala at
                        night,
                        flying 200 counter air and interdiction missions against these and other Pakistani bases,
                        including
                        those at
                        Akwal, Peshawar, Kohat, ChakJhumra and Risalwala. The virtuosity of the Hunters was fully
                        demonstrated, Nos.
                        7, 20 and 27 Squadrons being employed in counter-air as well as interdiction and close air
                        support
                        missions
                        in the West while Hunters of No. 14 Squadron battled with Sabres of the PAF No. 14 squadron
                        raiding
                        the IAF
                        base at Kalaikunda in the East. The Mysteres were employed primarily in the ground attack role
                        in
                        which they
                        proved extremely effective, with their swaths of 5 5 mm rockets most effective against armoured
                        vehicles.
                        Perhaps the most outstanding operational success was enjoyed by the Gnat, the three squadrons of
                        which
                        provided the air defence mainstay by flying CAPs over most operational IAF bases as well as
                        fulfilling
                        escort missions. Indeed, such was its success particularly against the F-86, that it was to earn
                        the
                        appellation of "Sabre Slayer". The September conflict was the first full-scale war in which the
                        post-independence IAF was involved and the Service learned many lessons as a result. Post mortem
                        examination
                        revealed some requirements, the pace of expansion being slowed while lessons were digested. It
                        was
                        realised
                        that too much emphasis had been placed on quantity at some cost in quality in order to cater for
                        the
                        dictates of the very high tempo IAF expansion embarked upon following the Sino-Indian War. This
                        had
                        necessitated cutting the duration of training courses to maximise personnel output and there was
                        evidence
                        that this could have some adverse effect on operational efficiency.. Emphasis was now reversed
                        in
                        that
                        quality once more took precedence over quanitity and training underwent major reorganization in
                        consequence.

                        On 03 Sep 1965, IAF Claimed its First Air to Air Kill.
                        Sqn Ldr Trevor Keelor shot down a Pakistani Sabre Jet F-86F aircraft in the Chhamb sector flying
                        in
                        his light weight Gnat fighter aircraft.
                        Four Gnats led by Sqn Ldr Trevor Keelor, flying in a tactical formation at low level (barely 100
                        feet above ground), were heading towards the combat zone in chhamb sector. As the formation was
                        crossing Akhnur Bridge, the controlling RADAR reported enemy aerial activity.
                        On receipt of the information, the Gnats zoomed up to 30,000 ft in less than 90 sec and scanned
                        the
                        area for intruders.
                        Sqn Ldr Keelor picked up a pair of Pakistani Sabre Jet F-86F, he maneuvered his formation to get
                        behind the enemy aircraft. As the turn was completed, Keelor was in a perfect position to close
                        in
                        and destroy the target. He opened fire with his twin 30 mm Canon guns from a distance of 450
                        yards,
                        closing in, to 200 yrds. In an instant the sabre’s right wing was disintegrated and the enemy
                        aircraft fell off the sky.
                        The IAF claimed its first aerial kill and Sqn Ldr Keelor became the first Indian Pilot to claim
                        a
                        jet in air-to-air combat.

                        On 04 Sep 1965, Flt Lt V. S. Pathania flying a Gnat
                        aircraft
                        shot down second PAF Sabre Jet aircraft over Chhamb sector.
                        While escorting a Mystere formation over Chhamb area, the escorts spotted four Sabres. The
                        Sabres
                        were intercepted by the Gnats.
                        Flying at a height of about 100 ft Flt Lt Pathania maneuvered to get in firing position
                        behind the
                        accelerating PAF Sabre aircraft, closing into a distance of less than 500 meters Pathania
                        opened
                        fire and achieved a direct hit on to the enemy Sabre. The aircraft was seen going down with
                        thick
                        smoke. This was the second aerial kill by IAF.

                    The professional standards, capability and flexibility of the much expanded Service were soon to be
                    put
                    to
                    the acid test. From early 1971, as the political situation on the sub-continent deteriorated, the
                    IAF
                    was
                    alerted to the possibility of another armed conflict. For some weeks in November, both Indian and
                    Pakistan
                    governments protested violations of national airspace along the western border, but aerial conflict
                    between
                    the respective air arms began in earnest on 22 November, preceding full-scale warfare between India
                    and
                    Pakistan by 12 days. At 1449 hours, four Pakistani Sabres strafed Indian and Mukti Bahini positions
                    in
                    the
                    Chowgacha Mor area, and 10 minutes later, while engaged on a third strafing run, the Sabres were
                    intercepted
                    by four Gnats from No. 22 Sqn, a detachment of which was operating from Dum Dum Airport, Calcutta.
                    During
                    the ensuing melee, three of the Sabres were shot down, all Gnats returning to base unscathed. The
                    first
                    blood of a new Indo-Pakistan air war had been drawn. Other encounters were to follow over the next
                    10
                    days,
                    within both Indian and Pakistani airspace, before full-scale war began on 3 December. Pre-emptive
                    strikes
                    were launched by the Pakistan Air Force against IAF bases at Srinagar, Amritsar and Pathankot,
                    followed
                    by
                    attacks on Ambala, Agra, Jodhpur, Uttarlai, Avantipur, Faridkot, Halwara and Sirsa. Apart from IAF
                    bases,
                    the PAF attacked railway stations, Indian armour concentrations and other targets. In response and
                    during
                    the ensuing two weeks, the IAF carried out some 4,000 sorties in the West from major and forward
                    bases
                    in
                    Jammu, Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan, while, in the East, a further 1,978 sorties were flown.

                <p>
                    Throughout the conflict, in which Indian strategy was to maintain basically defensive postures on
                    the
                    western and northern fronts whilst placing emphasis on a lightning campaign in the east, the IAF
                    established
                    a highly credible serviceability rate which exceeded 80 per cent. Mission emphasis throughout was on
                    interdiction. In the West the IAF's primary tasks were disruption of enemy communications, the
                    destruction
                    of fuel and ammunition reserves, and the prevention of any ground force concentrations so that no
                    major
                    offensive could be mounted against India while Indian forces were primarily engaged in the East. On
                    the
                    Eastern front, the Indian forces launched a sophisticated campaign which included rapid-moving
                    infantry
                    and
                    armour advancing from three directions, airborne and heliborne assaults, missile bombardments from
                    ships
                    and
                    an amphibious landing, the IAF's task being primarily direct support of the ground forces. In a
                    classic
                    air
                    action in the Western desert, four Hunters of the OCU, detachment at Jaisalmer destroyed an entire
                    armoured
                    regiment at Longewala, literally stopping the enemy offensive in its tracks.

                    The IAF had good reason for satisfaction with its showing during the December 1971 conflict.
                    Although
                    Pakistan had initiated the war with pre-emptive air strikes against major forward air bases, the IAF
                    rapidly
                    gained the initiative and had thereafter dominated the skies over both fronts. Admittedly, there had
                    to
                    be
                    war losses but the IAF flew many more sorties than its opponent with interdiction missions
                    predominating,
                    and the bulk of the Service's attrition was the result of intensive anti-aircraft fire; in aerial
                    combat,
                    the IAF proved its superiority in no uncertain manner. First round had gone to the Gnats, again, but
                    its
                    later compatriots, the MiG-21s, were to shortly demonstrate the superiority of this supersonic
                    fighter,
                    flown by professionals. Six squadrons of MiG-21FLs were part of the IAF's order-of battle,
                    participating
                    in
                    operations both in the Eastern and Western Sectors. Three MiG-21 squadrons, operating from Gauhati
                    and
                    Tezpur,took part in counter-air, escort and close air support tasks during the blitzkrieg action in
                    Bangladesh. That the MiG-21 was highly effective in short range, precision attacks was amply
                    demonstrated
                    during the attacks with 500 kg bombs on the PAF's air bases at Tezgaon and Kurmitola, while pin
                    point 57
                    mm

                    It was in the Western theatre that the MiG-21 was employed in its primary task, that of air defence,
                    escort
                    and interception. Deployed at all the major air bases, from Pathankot in the north to Jamnagar in
                    the
                    South
                    Western area, the MiG-21FLs mounted hundreds of combat air patrol sorties over Vital Points (VP) and
                    Vital
                    Areas (VA), flew escort missions for bombers and strike fighters and were continuously scrambled to
                    intercept hostile intruders. The MiG-21 finally met its original adversary, the F- 104 Starfighter,
                    in
                    air
                    combat over the Subcontinent during the December 1971 conflict and in all four recorded cases of
                    classic
                    dog
                    fights, the MiG-21s outclassed and out fought the F- 104s. The first aerial victory was on 12
                    December
                    1971,
                    when MiG-21FLs of No. 47 Squadron shot down a PAF F-104 over the Gulf of Kutch and this was followed
                    by
                    three more victories in quick succession on 17 December, when MiG-21FLs of No. 29 Squadron escorting
                    HF-24
                    Maruts, shot down intercepting F-104s near Uttarlai in the Rajsthan desert in gun-missile
                    encounters,
                    while
                    a third F-104, on an intruding mission, was shot down by another MiG 21FL of No.29 Squadron.

                    The December 1971 war also meant the gaining of India's highest award for gallantry to the IAF.
                    Flying
                    Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, flying Gnats with No. 18 Squadron from Srinagar, was posthumously
                    awarded
                    the Param Vir Chakra. Notwithstanding the successful campaign of December 1971 which created both
                    history
                    and geography, the Indian Air Force had lessons to draw from subsequent analyses of the conflict,
                    although
                    for the most part, these lessons dictated refinement rather than any fundamental change.

            <div class="panel"><br>
                <p>Operation Meghdoot was launched in 1984, it aimed to capture the Siachen Glacier. It was quite a
                    unique operation because of Siachen’s dreaded terrain and unforgiving climate. The mission was a
                    successful one, India gained control over the Siachen Glacier. India now controls the 70 kilometres
                    long
                    glacier and the three major passes west of it (Sia La,
                    Bilafond La, and Gyong La). Whereas Pakistan controls the area west of Saltoro Ridge. The TIME
                    magazine states, India has control over 1,000 square miles of territory because of its exceptional
                    military operation.</p>
                <p>IAF had played a major role in this operation. It used<em> Il-76, An-12, and An-32</em> to transport
                    troops and drop supplies to these extremely high altitude battlefields. Following
                    which,&nbsp;<em>Mi-17, Mi-8 and HAL Chetak&nbsp;</em>would carry the same to the east. IAF’s
                    performance
                    was incredible, taking into account how extreme the temperature and altitude are at
                    Siachen. The operation is a saga which showcased such skill that can never be forgotten.</p>
                <p>When the first IAF sortie was launched to Siachen on 20th September 1978, Chetak helicopters used to
                    supply stores to the on-ground Indian Army. That’s when a thought occurred to one of the IAF
                    officers “Why not pick their emails for their loved ones back home?”&nbsp;They used to drop a string
                    with a note saying “We are coming back in 10 minutes. Please write your letters and put them in a
                    bag.”</p>
                <p>This kind gesture of the Indian Air Force symbolized the brotherhood of ‘men in arms’. It also
                    boosted the morale of Indian Army troops who were leading expeditions on the ‘third pole of the
                    world’.</p>
                <p>IAF helicopters used to fly at the height of 16,000 feet, many times, the officers had to take oxygen
                    directly from the pipe. They also had the job of taking injured troops back to base camp. However,
                    it isn’t as simple as it sounds.</p>
                <p>Finding the expedition parties in the never-ending desert of ice, then landing the helicopter on the
                    lumps of snow were tasks that required unmistakable skill. The pilots have to brave temperatures as
                    low
                    as -
                    60<sup>o</sup>C, strong winds, lack of oxygen and flying in poor weather
                    conditions in close proximity of hills. There is always the threat of
                    powerful downdrafts that pull the helicopters down, if the pilots are
                    not careful. Added to that is the fact that the helicopters are flying
                    at the edge of their flight envelope where the power margin available is
                    small, if not negligible. Any miscalculation or mishandling of controls
                    can result in a catastrophic accident. Over and above, there is the
                    omnipresent threat of enemy fire. The pilots fly fast and low to give
                    the minimum reaction time to the enemy. The landing on the match box
                    sized helipads is precise; the Army Jawans open the door, take out the
                    load, put in the mail/casualty and the pilot executes a take- off -in
                    the reciprocal direction. The total time on the helipad does not exceed
                    2 to 30 seconds. The return to the Base Camp is fast, a quick turn
                    around of the aircraft is done while the pilots have a cup of tea and
                    the aircraft takes off for the next mission.

                        some thirty months and the statistics tell it all: some 70,000 sorties were flown by the IAF's
                        transport and helicopter force to and within&nbsp;Sri Lanka, without a single aircraft lost or
                        mission aborted. In support of nearly 100,000 troops and paramilitary forces, IAF An32s
                        maintained a
                        continuous air link from air bases in Southern India to Divisional headquarters at Palaly

                        concentrated space and time in thehistoryofthearmed forces of&nbsp;India. In 20 days, some 3000
                        tactical transport and assault helicopter sorties were carried out during the bitter fighting to

                        providing air transportation to Sri Lankan civil administration during the elections. Mi-25s of

                <p>On the night of November 3, 1988, the Indian Air Force mounted special operations to airlift a
                    parachute
                    battalion group from Agra, non-stop over 2000 km. out beyond the South-Western coast of India to the
                    remote Indian Ocean archipelago of the Maldives. In response to that Government's appeal for
                    military
                    help against a mercenary invasion, the IL-76s of No. 44 Squadron landed at Hulule at 0030 hours, the

                <h3 class=midheads>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The IAF was first approached to provide air support on 11 May 99 with the use of helicopters. This
                    was
                    followed by ago ahead given on 25 May by the CCS to the IAF to mount attacks on the infiltrators
                    without
                    crossing the LoC. While there was considerable pressure from outside the IAF to operate only attack
                    helicopters, the CAS succeeded in convincing the Govt that in order to create a suitable environment
                    for
                    the
                    helicopters, fighter action was required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Operation Safedsagar, as the air operations in the Kargil area were called, was, indeed, a milestone
                    in
                    the
                    history of military aviation, as this was the first time that air power was employed in such an
                    environment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class=midheads>Effect of Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    The severe degradation of aircraft and weapon performance is difficult for the layman to completely
                    appreciate. No aircraft has yet been designed to operate in a Kargil-like environment. At high
                    altitudes, a
                    crucial factor in aircraft performance is the reserve of power available, which, for the MiG and
                    Mirage
                    fleets, was a strong point in their favor. In comparision, the Fairchild A-10, which was widely
                    quoted
                    as
                    being the ideal platform, would have been a misfit. It is widely (and incorrectly) stated that using
                    Mach 2
                    aircraft would not produce results; however, all air-to-ground attack speeds are approximately the
                    same
                    attack speeds (750-950 kmph) for all fixed-wing aircraft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the very different attributes of the atmosphere, even weapons do not perform as per sea-level
                    specifications. Variations in air temperature and density, altering drag indices and a host of other
                    factors
                    (which have never been calculated by any manufacturer for this type of altitude) cause weapons to go
                    off
                    their mark; for the same reasons, normally reliable computerised weapon aiming devices give
                    inaccurate
                    results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the plains, a 1000 pounder bomb landing 25 yards away from the target would still severely
                    disable,
                    if
                    not flatten, it. In the mountains, however, a miss of a few yards would be as good as the proverbial
                    mile,
                    due to the undulating terrain and masking effects. In addition, due to the variation in elevation
                    the
                    "miss"
                    would be greatly magnified in the linear dimension, further exaggerating the "inaccuracy" of the
                    weapon/delivery. While this would lead to apparent inaccuracies in weapon delivery, there is, thus,
                    a
                    need
                    for pinpoint accuracy in conditions where that very attribute is severely degraded by the factors
                    mentioned
                    above.

                <h3 class=midheads>The First Few Days</h3>
                <p>
                    The loss of one fighter and one Mi-17 chopper to enemy action indicated the need for a change of
                    tactics,
                    resulting in withdrawal of armed helicopters and employment of fighters in modified profiles out of
                    the
                    Stinger SAM envelope. By itself, the change of tactics is nothing unusual, and is an inherent part
                    of
                    the
                    qualities of flexibility and adaptability; in fact, a far more serious lapse would be a dogged
                    tendency
                    to
                    persist in sacrificing assets when, clearly, there was a need for a re-assessment. It is, perhaps
                    for
                    this
                    reason that NATO, after deploying 100 Apache attack helicopters in Greece, reconsidered bringing
                    them
                    into
                    Kosovo till the shooting was over, as they felt the environment didn't justify it. Unfortunately,
                    IAF
                    Mi-25/35 attack helicopters were not able to operate in this terrain.

                    One of the many facts that have emerged clearly is that target acquisition by the pilot is the
                    bottom
                    line.
                    Totally unfamiliar surroundings in the Kargil area made target recognition difficult from the
                    ground,
                    let
                    alone from a fast moving aircraft. As a result, the initial few sorties from high levels were not
                    effective
                    as desired. However, once revised and modified profiles, tactics and manner of system usage had been
                    perfected, the accuracy of the airstrikes improved dramatically. Any time the target was spotted, a
                    very
                    high success rate invariably resulted.

                <p>
                    The picture one normally associates with airstrikes emphasises helmeted pilots starting up their
                    aircraft,
                    flying to the target in the teeth of intense anti-aircraft fire and battling their way through
                    hordes of
                    enemy fighters to press home their attacks despite superhuman odds. In all fairness, that's the way
                    it
                    actually happened until the Second World War - the famous 1000 bomber raids over Germany, with the
                    US
                    8th
                    Air Force flying by day and the RAF by night, at a terrible cost in lives and machines.

                    Even at that time, though, the "back-room boys", that anonymous bunch of faceless experts who lived
                    their
                    lives poring over reconnaissance (recce) photographs, noting detail after painstaking detail,
                    provided
                    the
                    target information that ultimately formed the basis of the bombing missions.

                <h3 class=midheads>The Increasing Effects of Airstrikes</h3>
                <p>
                    As a result of these attacks, severe damage to enemy personnel and equipment became apparent in
                    various
                    areas. It is surmised that airstrikes contributed to a significant portion of the enemy's casualty
                    list,
                    as
                    apparent in the numbers. However, the most telling effects on the ground were from intercepts of
                    enemy
                    radio
                    revealing severe shortage of rations, water, medicines and ammunition. Losses due to airstrikes and
                    inability to evacuate their casualties were also mentioned in the intercepts. <strong>This was the
                        actual
                        manifestation on the ground of the result of effective airstrikes by the IAF.</strong> The
                    effect of
                    accurate attacks
                    is best summed up by a message received from one of the HQ of the Indian Army.......

                    "You guys have done a wonderful job. Your Mirage boys with their precision laser guided bombs

                    enemy Battalion HQ in Tiger Hill area with tremendous success. Five Pakistani officers reported

                    in
                    that attack and their Command and Control broke down - as a result of which our troops have

                    walked
                    over the entire Tiger Hills area. The enemy is on the run. They are on the run in other sectors
                    also. At
                    this rate the end of the conflict may come soon."

                <h3 class=midheads>IAF Air Strikes : The Results</h3>
                <p>
                    IAF air strikes against enemy supply camps and other targets yielded rich dividends. A noteworthy
                    fact
                    is
                    that there was not a single operation on ground that was not preceded by airstrikes, each and every
                    one
                    of
                    which was the result of coordinated planning between 15 Corps and the AOC, J&K. However, one of the
                    valuable
                    lessons that emerged was the need for joint Army-Air Force planning and consultations from the very
                    beginning, where the Air Force would be able to contribute by rendering advice on targeting which
                    could,
                    at
                    the very outset, be incorporated into the Army plan of ground operations. This would prove far more
                    effective than a case where the Army proceeded as per its own plans made earlier in isolation, and
                    called
                    for air support when they felt it was required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Firstly</strong>, in the area of interdiction of enemy supplies, the successful and
                    incessant
                    attacks on the enemy's
                    logistic machine had, over the last few weeks, culminated in a serious degradation of the enemy's
                    ability to
                    sustain himself in an increasing number of areas. The series of attacks against Pt 4388 in the Dras
                    sector
                    was an excellent example of how lethal airstrikes combined with timely reconnaissance detected the
                    enemy
                    plans to shift to alternate supply routes which were once again effectively attacked. In this the
                    IAF
                    succeeded in strangling the enemy supply arteries, amply testified to by enemy radio intercepts. The
                    primacy
                    of interdiction targets as opposed to Battlefield Air Strikes (BAS) targets was clearly brought out,
                    as
                    also
                    the fact that <em>power is not to be frittered away on insignificant targets like machine gun posts
                        and
                        trenches, but on large targets of consequence (like the supply camp at Muntho Dhalo, enemy
                        Battalion
                        HQ
                        on
                        top of Tiger Hill, etc). Gone are the days of fighters screaming in at deck level, acting as a
                        piece
                        of
                        extended artillery. The air defence environment of today's battlefield just does not permit such
                        employment
                        of airpower anymore, a significant fact that needs to be understood by soldier and civilian
                        alike.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>second</strong> major impact of air power in this operation was in the area of
                    casualties.
                    Normally, an enemy
                    defending a well fortified position (in this case, Pakistan) suffers between 3-6 times less
                    casualties
                    than
                    does the force on the offensive. However, this operation has seen the reverse, with the enemy
                    casualties
                    far
                    in excess of those suffered by us. One significant fact must not be lost sight of; of the two
                    warring
                    sides,
                    it is the Pakistani Army that suffered air strikes, which, obviously, contributed significantly to
                    its
                    casualties. It is felt that without the use of air power, our own casualties could have approached
                    if
                    not
                    exceeded four figures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>third</strong> aspect is that of attack chopper operations. IAF dedicated attack
                    choppers
                    like
                    the Mi-35 were
                    incapable of operating at that altitude, which prompted the use of armed and modified Mi-17s for the
                    role.
                    Besides the capability of the machine itself vis-a-vis the area of operation, the creation of the
                    right
                    air
                    defence environment is a crucial factor which would determine the employment of this platform.
                    Effectiveness
                    versus vulnerability would need to be examined; during Op Safedsagar, the abundance of man portable
                    SAMs
                    in
                    all enemy-held areas precluded the effective employment of attack choppers. As a result, whether
                    Army or
                    IAF, choppers were constrained to operate in SAM-free areas. Nevertheless, IAF Cheetahs were
                    instrumental in
                    carrying out front line roles like providing a platform for the Airborne Forward Air Controller
                    (FAC), a
                    fighter pilot who guides the fighters in to the attack against ground targets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>fourth</strong> major impact of air power is in the enormous difference it made to the
                    ground
                    operations, no
                    better example of which exists than the message from the HQ of a field Army unit, (shown in italics
                    above)
                    stating that <em>" as a result of the precision airstrikes on Tiger Hills our troops have literally
                        walked
                        over
                        the entire Tiger Hills area. The enemy is on the run.."</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fifthly</strong>, night operations were carried out using ingenuity and imagination; at
                    times,
                    excellent results were
                    achieved by aircraft like MiG-21s using little else but a stop watch and a GPS receiver. These
                    operations
                    had a significant effect on the enemy's resilience, stamina and very will to fight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sixthly</strong>, the effort put into air defence escorts and area Combat Air Patrolling by
                    day
                    as
                    well as night
                    proved an effective deterrent which ensured total air superiority. At times, PAF F-16s orbited a
                    scant
                    15
                    kms (on their own side of the LOC) from our strike formations attacking Pakistani targets, kept at
                    bay
                    by
                    our own air defence fighters flying a protective pattern above the strike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>seventh</strong> aspect is the high degree of imagination, felexibility and IAF-Army
                    coordination which marked
                    every phase of the operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the <strong>final</strong> analysis, the effective application of air power has indisputably
                    saved
                    further casualties as
                    well as compressed considerably the timeframe in which our Army has made such progress on the
                    ground. In
                    this context, the basic functions of air power have been repeated, though on a much larger scale,
                    when
                    compared to the IAF's operations in this area during 1947-48, when IAF Tempests carried out strafing
                    and
                    rocket attacks on the intruders and Dakotas ferried in as well as paradropped troops and supplies.
                    As
                    then
                    and now, when called upon by the nation the IAF has joined as an equal partner to the Army to meet
                    the
                    national objective.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class=midheads>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Almost from the very beginning of the operations, IAF intellects were busy ticking over in a near
                    constant
                    brain-storming session aimed at deriving lessons from Operation Safedsagar. Being an ongoing
                    process,
                    the
                    immense experience gained from this operation would stand in good stead in the times to come. These
                    lessons
                    would be applicable to all the world's Air Forces, for it is the first time in the history of
                    military
                    aviation that such an air operation took place in such an environment. While conventional
                    long-accepted
                    air
                    power theories no longer held good, a new set of operating paradigms had to be evolved almost
                    overnight
                    to
                    cope with the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the first time the IAF fought a limited war, hitherto thought to be an unlikely eventuality,
                    as
                    air
                    power and escalation to an all-out war were thought to be synonymous. The deterrent effect of air
                    power
                    has
                    been enhanced by this fact, as the prospect of decisive air action is now a proven possibility in
                    even a
                    Low
                    Intensity Conflict situation.
                </p>
                <p class=last>
                    Operation Safedsagar was, therefore, a turning point in the history of military aviation, and an
                    operation
                    that will, no doubt, be discussed and dissected for the next few decades.
